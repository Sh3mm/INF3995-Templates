# Dev Environment

We recommend using Ubuntu 22.04. To install everything that you will need, a [bash script](Installation%2FUbuntu22.04) has been made available to you.

The best dev environment is using Ubuntu 22.04 directly. However, we realise not everyone might want this and as such, we created a [Dockerfile](Installation%2FAny-Docker-VNC) to let you work on the project from any Operating system. 

For those who want a bit of fun, we also added a second [Dockerfile](Installation%2FLinux-Docker-X11) for running using native x11 GUI. This will not work for everyone and might require a bit of tweeking
