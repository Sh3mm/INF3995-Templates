# Raw Ubuntu 22.04

This Script will install all requirements for the project. It is made to be run on a Ubuntu 22.04 system.

this is by far the easiest option to use since no containers are required. However this also means that everything is done locally and uninstalling everything after the project is much more complicated.

## How to use:

Run the script as sudo to install everything:
```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```
