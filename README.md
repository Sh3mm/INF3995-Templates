# INF3995-Templates

Welcome To INF3995. This repo contains all the base templates you will need for this semester's project!

## Dev environment
The best dev environment is using Ubuntu 22.04 directly. however, we realise not everyone might want this and as such, we created a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/Sh3mm/INF3995-Templates/tree/main/Any-Docker-VNC) to let you work on the project from any Operating system. 

For those who want a bit of fun, we also added a second [Dockerfile](https://github.com/Sh3mm/INF3995-Templates/tree/main/Linux-Docker-X11) for running using native x11 GUI. This will not work for everyone and might require a bit of tweeking

## Runing the base simulation

Work in progress
